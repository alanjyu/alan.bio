After learning and developing locally using Visual Studio Code for a while, I've decided to move all local work to GitHub for convenience. There are several external javascripts used; hopefully I will be able to replace them by writing my own scripts.

The entire website and its codes are under the MIT License. You're more than welcome to fork and modify my work, as long as it is credited properly.
