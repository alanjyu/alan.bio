## Getting Started
After learning and developing locally using Visual Studio Code for a while, I've decided to move all my local work to GitHub for convenience. The website is displayed in [docs/](https://github.com/alanjyu/alanjyu.com/tree/master/docs). The commits might look messy as I'm still learning to use git.

## Compatibility
The website is tested with Chrome 80+, and should work in all evergreen browsers. However, I have not focused much on mobile optimization.

## Dependencies
I am using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle all my source to the docs/ folder. All the other dependencies are listed in [package.json](https://github.com/alanjyu/alanjyu.com/blob/master/package.json).
